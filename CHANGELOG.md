## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- SerializableGuid now no longer tries to serialize a null or empty guidString value on deserialization. (Typically when being used as a Key value in another structure).
- SerializableGuidPropertyDrawer no longer draws the properties label if it is null or empty, this now allows it to be properly visualised when its used as a key in other data structures.
